This is a very simple showcase website for products. I have created this using **ReactJS**. For styling purpose, I have used **Tailwind CSS** framework. For managing states of this application, I have used **React-Redux**. This application is getting all the products' data from **Fakeshop API**. I have used **axios** for API calls and **React-Router** to link pages. This website is completely responsive.
